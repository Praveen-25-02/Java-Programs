As part of my hands-on learning and project development experience, I have applied Java extensively to solve problems involving arrays, strings, and linked lists. I have implemented various algorithms such as finding the largest and smallest elements, reversing arrays, checking sorting, and handling operations like moving zeros to the end and finding the second largest element. In string manipulation, I have worked on reversing strings, checking for palindromes, counting character types, and solving challenges like finding non-repeating characters, checking for anagrams, and substring searching. Additionally, in linked lists, I have solved problems such as reversing the list, detecting cycles, finding the middle element, merging sorted lists, removing duplicates, and finding specific nodes. These experiences have provided me with a strong foundation in using fundamental data structures to solve a variety of programming challenges efficiently.
